objective: given a project's module's function or class or method, need to generate all test case scenarios and for each scenario, need to generate test code.

here are few steps i can think of for writing agentic flow. these steps are nothing but scenarios, specially in each scenario how test code needs to be written, so that it generates code without much error.

scenario-1: if a function/method is straight forward means function doesn't have dependencies with other modules(class or function or method. excluding builtin packages) then writing test code is simple. 

scenario-2: if a function/method is comples means it's input parameter takes pydantic object as input or any third party connection like DB or API or File object or body of function/method/class has other modules function/method/class call statement then writing test code is not simple.

we can break down scenario-2 into more granular details.
complexity-1: if function/method/class has dependency with other modules function/method which is written in body then we have to mock it with making function or method call return  true as we are not testing dependency function here rather it's given input function/method/class. 
and if it's a dependency with third party connection like DB or API or File or custom class with data attributes, then we can create pytest fixture to define once and use whereever required.

complexity-2: if function/method input or class constructor has dependency with third party connection like DB or API or File or custom class with data attributes, then we can create pytest fixture to define once and use whereever required.

-----------------------
To determine if the questions asked by the "ask_questions" agent are meaningful and sufficient for generating test case code, let's consider the minimum information required while writing unit test cases.
When writing unit tests for a function, class, or method, the key aspects to consider are:
Input parameters: The test cases should cover different combinations of input parameters, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
Expected output: The tests should verify that the function or method returns the expected output for various inputs.
Side effects: If the function or method has any side effects, such as modifying global variables or interacting with external resources, the tests should ensure that these side effects are handled correctly.
Exceptions: The tests should cover scenarios where the function or method might throw exceptions and ensure that they are handled appropriately.
Dependencies: If the function or method depends on other functions, methods, or external resources (e.g., database connections, API calls, file system), the tests should handle these dependencies using techniques like mocking or stubbing.
Based on these considerations, the questions asked by the "ask_questions" agent seem to cover the essential aspects:
Can input parameters be mocked with the given information? (Covers input parameters)
Can dependency functions/methods/classes defined in the body be mocked? (Covers dependencies)
Is the function/method/class simple or complex? (Helps determine the approach for generating test cases)
List any additional questions needed to gather more information for mocking objects. (Allows for gathering more information if needed)
Is fixture creation required? (Indicates if fixtures are needed to set up test environments)
Is mock creation required? (Determines if mocks are needed to handle dependencies)
These questions provide a good starting point for gathering the necessary information to generate test case code. However, there are a few additional questions that could be considered:
What are the expected outputs for different input scenarios? (Helps verify the expected behavior)
Are there any specific exceptions that should be handled? (Ensures that exception handling is covered in the tests)
Are there any global variables or side effects that need to be considered? (Helps identify and handle side effects in the tests)
By incorporating these additional questions, the "ask_questions" agent can gather more comprehensive information to generate robust and thorough test case code.

---------------------------
Flow Structure for Generating Unit Test Code
1. Initial State: Start with the function, class, or method definition that needs to be tested.
2. Ask Questions Agent:
This agent asks a series of questions to gather essential information about the function, including:
Can input parameters be mocked?
Can dependencies be mocked?
Is the function simple or complex?
Are there any additional questions needed?
Is fixture creation required?
Is mock creation required?
Decision Point: Based on the responses, the agent will determine the complexity of the function and whether additional information is needed.
3. Process Responses Agent:
This agent analyzes the responses from the "ask_questions" agent.
Decision Logic:
If the function is simple and all inputs can be mocked, proceed to generate test code directly.
If the function is complex or if any dependencies cannot be mocked, proceed to collect additional user input.
If fixture or mock creation is required, route to the respective agents.
4. Collect User Input Agent:
If additional information is needed, this agent will ask targeted follow-up questions based on the previous responses.
Decision Point: Once the user provides the necessary information, the flow returns to the "process responses" agent for re-evaluation.
5. Generate Fixtures Agent:
If fixture creation is required, this agent generates the necessary fixture code based on the function definition and previous responses.
After generating fixtures, it passes control to the mock generation agent.
6. Generate Mock Code Agent:
If mock creation is required, this agent generates the necessary mock code.
After generating mocks, it passes control to the test code generation agent.
7. Generate Test Code Agent:
This agent compiles all the information gathered (function definition, fixture code, mock code) and generates the final unit test code.
This is the final output of the flow.

--------------------------------------

Decision-Making Logic
1. From Ask Questions to Process Responses:
Collect all responses and determine if further action is needed.
2. From Process Responses:
If all responses are satisfactory:
Directly move to Generate Test Code.
If more information is needed:
Move to Collect User Input.
3. From Collect User Input:
Once additional information is gathered, return to Process Responses.
4. From Process Responses to Generate Fixtures or Generate Mock Code:
Depending on whether fixtures or mocks are required, route to the appropriate agent.
5. Final Compilation:
Once all components (fixtures, mocks) are ready, compile them in the Generate Test Code agent.

Can input parameters be mocked?
Intent: Determine if the input parameters of the function can be mocked or simulated with predefined values.
Example: Suppose you have a function add_numbers(a, b) that takes two integers as input. To mock the input parameters, you can provide predefined values for a and b in the test code, like this:
python
def test_add_numbers():
    result = add_numbers(5, 3)
    assert result == 8

Prompt: Given the function definition, can the input parameters be replaced with predefined values for testing purposes? Provide a brief explanation and an example code snippet to illustrate your answer.
Can dependencies be mocked?
Intent: Determine if the function's dependencies, such as other functions, classes, or external resources, can be mocked or stubbed.
Example: Suppose the add_numbers function internally calls another function validate_input(a, b) to validate the input parameters. To mock this dependency, you can use a mocking library like unittest.mock in Python:
python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('module.validate_input')
def test_add_numbers(mock_validate_input):
    mock_validate_input.return_value = True
    result = add_numbers(5, 3)
    assert result == 8

Prompt: Can the dependencies of the function, such as other functions, classes, or external resources, be mocked or stubbed for testing purposes? Provide a brief explanation and an example code snippet to illustrate your answer.
Is the function simple or complex?
Intent: Determine the complexity of the function based on factors such as the number of conditional statements, loops, or dependencies.
Example: A simple function might have a straightforward implementation with minimal conditional statements and dependencies, while a complex function might have multiple conditional statements, loops, and dependencies.
Prompt: Based on the function definition, would you consider the function to be simple or complex? Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.
Are there any additional questions needed?
Intent: Determine if any additional information is required to generate test cases for the function.
Example: Depending on the function's complexity and dependencies, you might need to ask additional questions about specific input scenarios, expected outputs, or edge cases.
Prompt: Based on the function definition and the information gathered so far, are there any additional questions you would need to ask to generate comprehensive test cases? If yes, please list the questions.
Is fixture creation required?
Intent: Determine if creating fixtures is necessary for setting up the test environment.
Example: Fixtures can be used to set up test data or create mock objects that are shared across multiple test cases. For example, in a database-driven application, you might need to create a fixture to set up a test database.
Prompt: Based on the function definition and the information gathered so far, is it necessary to create fixtures to set up the test environment? Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.
Is mock creation required?
Intent: Determine if creating mocks is necessary for simulating dependencies or external resources.
Example: Mocks can be used to simulate the behavior of dependencies or external resources, such as API calls or file system interactions.
Prompt: Based on the function definition and the information gathered so far, is it necessary to create mocks to simulate dependencies or external resources? Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.

. Simple Fixture Example
In this example, we create a simple fixture that provides a value to the test function.
python
# fixtures.py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_value():
    return 42

def test_sample_value(sample_value):
    assert sample_value == 42

2. Fixture with Setup and Teardown
This example demonstrates a fixture that sets up a resource (like a database connection) and tears it down afterward.
python
# fixtures.py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def db_connection():
    # Setup: Create a database connection
    connection = "Database Connection Established"
    yield connection  # This is where the test will run
    # Teardown: Close the database connection
    connection = None
    print("Database Connection Closed")

def test_db_connection(db_connection):
    assert db_connection == "Database Connection Established"

3. Fixture with Parameters
You can create parameterized fixtures that allow you to run the same test with different inputs.
python
# fixtures.py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(params=[1, 2, 3])
def number(request):
    return request.param

def test_square(number):
    assert number * number == number ** 2

4. Using Fixtures for Mocking
In this example, we use a fixture to create a mock object that can be reused across multiple tests.
python
# fixtures.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_service():
    mock = Mock()
    mock.get_data.return_value = {"key": "value"}
    return mock

def test_service(mock_service):
    assert mock_service.get_data() == {"key": "value"}

def test_service_another_case(mock_service):
    assert mock_service.get_data() is not None

5. Fixture for External Resources
This example shows how to use a fixture to manage an external resource, such as a temporary file.
python
# fixtures.py
import pytest
import tempfile
import os

@pytest.fixture
def temp_file():
    # Setup: Create a temporary file
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:
        yield f.name  # Provide the temporary file name to the test
    # Teardown: Remove the temporary file
    os.remove(f.name)

def test_temp_file(temp_file):
    with open(temp_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write("Hello, World!")
    
    with open(temp_file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    assert content == "Hello, World!"

6. Fixture for API Testing
In this example, we use a fixture to set up a mock API response for testing.
python
# fixtures.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

@pytest.fixture
def mock_api_response():
    with patch('requests.get') as mock_get:
        mock_get.return_value.json.return_value = {"status": "success", "data": "Sample Data"}
        yield mock_get

def test_api_call(mock_api_response):
    import requests
    response = requests.get("http://api.example.com/data")
    assert response.json() == {"status": "success", "data": "Sample Data"}

 Here's an example of unit testing a class with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for a document-oriented database like MongoDB using pytest and pymongo (the Python driver for MongoDB).
Let's assume we have a User class with CRUD methods:
python
# user.py
from pymongo import MongoClient

class User:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
        self.db = self.client['test_db']
        self.collection = self.db['users']

    def create_user(self, user_data):
        result = self.collection.insert_one(user_data)
        return result.inserted_id

    def read_user(self, user_id):
        user = self.collection.find_one({'_id': user_id})
        return user

    def update_user(self, user_id, updates):
        result = self.collection.update_one({'_id': user_id}, {'$set': updates})
        return result.modified_count

    def delete_user(self, user_id):
        result = self.collection.delete_one({'_id': user_id})
        return result.deleted_count

Now, let's write unit tests for this class using pytest and mongomock (a mocking library for MongoDB):
python
# test_user.py
import pytest
from user import User
from mongomock import MongoClient

@pytest.fixture
def user_instance():
    with MongoClient():
        yield User()

def test_create_user(user_instance):
    user_data = {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'}

    assert user_id is not None

def test_read_user(user_instance):
    user_data = {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'email': 'jane@example.com'}
    user_id = user_instance.create_user(user_data)
    user = user_instance.read_user(user_id)
    assert user['name'] == 'Jane Smith'
    assert user['email'] == 'jane@example.com'

def test_update_user(user_instance):
    user_data = {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'email': 'bob@example.com'}
    user_id = user_instance.create_user(user_data)
    updates = {'email': 'updated@example.com'}
    modified_count = user_instance.update_user(user_id, updates)
    assert modified_count == 1
    updated_user = user_instance.read_user(user_id)
    assert updated_user['email'] == 'updated@example.com'

def test_delete_user(user_instance):
    user_data = {'name': 'Alice Williams', 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
    user_id = user_instance.create_user(user_data)
    deleted_count = user_instance.delete_user(user_id)

Example Code for OpenAI Call
First, let's define a function that makes a call to the OpenAI API for text generation:
python
# openai_service.py
import openai

def generate_text(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
