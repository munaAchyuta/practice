objective: given a project's module's function or class or method, need to generate all test case scenarios and for each scenario, need to generate test code.

here are few steps i can think of for writing agentic flow. these steps are nothing but scenarios, specially in each scenario how test code needs to be written, so that it generates code without much error.

scenario-1: if a function/method is straight forward means function doesn't have dependencies with other modules(class or function or method. excluding builtin packages) then writing test code is simple. 

scenario-2: if a function/method is comples means it's input parameter takes pydantic object as input or any third party connection like DB or API or File object or body of function/method/class has other modules function/method/class call statement then writing test code is not simple.

we can break down scenario-2 into more granular details.
complexity-1: if function/method/class has dependency with other modules function/method which is written in body then we have to mock it with making function or method call return  true as we are not testing dependency function here rather it's given input function/method/class. 
and if it's a dependency with third party connection like DB or API or File or custom class with data attributes, then we can create pytest fixture to define once and use whereever required.

complexity-2: if function/method input or class constructor has dependency with third party connection like DB or API or File or custom class with data attributes, then we can create pytest fixture to define once and use whereever required.

-----------------------
To determine if the questions asked by the "ask_questions" agent are meaningful and sufficient for generating test case code, let's consider the minimum information required while writing unit test cases.
When writing unit tests for a function, class, or method, the key aspects to consider are:
Input parameters: The test cases should cover different combinations of input parameters, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
Expected output: The tests should verify that the function or method returns the expected output for various inputs.
Side effects: If the function or method has any side effects, such as modifying global variables or interacting with external resources, the tests should ensure that these side effects are handled correctly.
Exceptions: The tests should cover scenarios where the function or method might throw exceptions and ensure that they are handled appropriately.
Dependencies: If the function or method depends on other functions, methods, or external resources (e.g., database connections, API calls, file system), the tests should handle these dependencies using techniques like mocking or stubbing.
Based on these considerations, the questions asked by the "ask_questions" agent seem to cover the essential aspects:
Can input parameters be mocked with the given information? (Covers input parameters)
Can dependency functions/methods/classes defined in the body be mocked? (Covers dependencies)
Is the function/method/class simple or complex? (Helps determine the approach for generating test cases)
List any additional questions needed to gather more information for mocking objects. (Allows for gathering more information if needed)
Is fixture creation required? (Indicates if fixtures are needed to set up test environments)
Is mock creation required? (Determines if mocks are needed to handle dependencies)
These questions provide a good starting point for gathering the necessary information to generate test case code. However, there are a few additional questions that could be considered:
What are the expected outputs for different input scenarios? (Helps verify the expected behavior)
Are there any specific exceptions that should be handled? (Ensures that exception handling is covered in the tests)
Are there any global variables or side effects that need to be considered? (Helps identify and handle side effects in the tests)
By incorporating these additional questions, the "ask_questions" agent can gather more comprehensive information to generate robust and thorough test case code.

---------------------------
Flow Structure for Generating Unit Test Code
1. Initial State: Start with the function, class, or method definition that needs to be tested.
2. Ask Questions Agent:
This agent asks a series of questions to gather essential information about the function, including:
Can input parameters be mocked?
Can dependencies be mocked?
Is the function simple or complex?
Are there any additional questions needed?
Is fixture creation required?
Is mock creation required?
Decision Point: Based on the responses, the agent will determine the complexity of the function and whether additional information is needed.
3. Process Responses Agent:
This agent analyzes the responses from the "ask_questions" agent.
Decision Logic:
If the function is simple and all inputs can be mocked, proceed to generate test code directly.
If the function is complex or if any dependencies cannot be mocked, proceed to collect additional user input.
If fixture or mock creation is required, route to the respective agents.
4. Collect User Input Agent:
If additional information is needed, this agent will ask targeted follow-up questions based on the previous responses.
Decision Point: Once the user provides the necessary information, the flow returns to the "process responses" agent for re-evaluation.
5. Generate Fixtures Agent:
If fixture creation is required, this agent generates the necessary fixture code based on the function definition and previous responses.
After generating fixtures, it passes control to the mock generation agent.
6. Generate Mock Code Agent:
If mock creation is required, this agent generates the necessary mock code.
After generating mocks, it passes control to the test code generation agent.
7. Generate Test Code Agent:
This agent compiles all the information gathered (function definition, fixture code, mock code) and generates the final unit test code.
This is the final output of the flow.

Decision-Making Logic
1. From Ask Questions to Process Responses:
Collect all responses and determine if further action is needed.
2. From Process Responses:
If all responses are satisfactory:
Directly move to Generate Test Code.
If more information is needed:
Move to Collect User Input.
3. From Collect User Input:
Once additional information is gathered, return to Process Responses.
4. From Process Responses to Generate Fixtures or Generate Mock Code:
Depending on whether fixtures or mocks are required, route to the appropriate agent.
5. Final Compilation:
Once all components (fixtures, mocks) are ready, compile them in the Generate Test Code agent.
